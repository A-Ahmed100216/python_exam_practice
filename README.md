## Assessment Categories
1. Design 
2. Language Knowledge
3. Problem Solving
4. Reliability

## Potential Exam Topics
* Collections - Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
* Syntax - Declaring variables
* Methods/ Functions
    * Syntax for declaring functions and methods is the same ```def name():```
    * Difference? Methods defined within classes, functions outside classes.
* Control Flow -if, else, elif
* Loops - for loops and while loops
* Operators
  * Arithmetic - ```+ - * / > < =```
  * Boolean - ```is``` , ```is not```
  * Comparatives - ```and``` ,```or```
 * Built-in methods 
   * list methods - append(), pop(), remove() etc.
   * string methods - upper(), lower()
* OOP 
  * 4 pillars, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction 
  * How can you inherit a class from x to y?
  * Syntax : ```class Name:```
  * Keywords: class, self, super, \_\_init__
  * Declare a method that takes 4 arguments- no class is needed 
  
## Practice Questions
1. Declare a list with numbers 1 to 5 and add 6 at the end.
```python
# Create a list making sure to use square brackets and print.
list=[1,2,3,4,5]
print(list)
# Use the append method to add 6 at the end
list.append(6)
# Print the new list
print(list)
```
